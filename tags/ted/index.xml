      <description>TEDxVITAP website
On the 10th of April 2021, VITAP held a TEDxVITAP event, which was named &amp;ldquo;The Unstoppables&amp;rdquo; . I was appointed as the website developer along with some other web developers.
This website was built using React JS framework.
I would like to thank Sai Pranay, Vineet Tiwari, and SK Saddam Hossain, who were my teammates in this project. Thank you guys.</description>
