      <description>COVID-19 Tracker App
During the pandemic, the stats of the number of the corona virus cases were everywhere. I thought it would be nice to create a web application to track the number of active covid cases, the number of patients recovered from COVID and the number of deaths. It includes both daily statistics and all time statistics
The web application is built using React JS framework and an API to collect the statistics to display the COVID-19 cases.</description>

      <description>TEDxVITAP website
On the 10th of April 2021, VITAP held a TEDxVITAP event, which was named &amp;ldquo;The Unstoppables&amp;rdquo; . I was appointed as the website developer along with some other web developers.
This website was built using React JS framework.
I would like to thank Sai Pranay, Vineet Tiwari, and SK Saddam Hossain, who were my teammates in this project. Thank you guys.</description>
